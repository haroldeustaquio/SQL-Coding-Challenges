# SQL Zoo Problems Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from [SQL Zoo](https://sqlzoo.net/), an interactive platform for learning and practicing SQL through hands-on exercises. SQL Zoo organizes its problems into different sections to cover different levels of difficulty and SQL concepts, and here you'll find my progress and solutions to each of them.
